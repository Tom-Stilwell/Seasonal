[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-javascript.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

Seasonal is a game that loops through each season in a year. As the seasons change, the player
comes up against various obstacles, both seen and unseen. The player must use screenshots
that reveal hidden barriers in order to move forward to the next season.
